"""The audit log: a tamper-evident record of what keepmum did and of every change to its protection.

~/.config/keepmum/audit.jsonl (0600), one JSON entry per line, shared by every keepmum process
on this Mac. Each entry carries `seq` (one more than the entry before), `prev` (the hash of the
entry before) and `hash`: SHA-256 of the entry's canonical JSON without `hash`. Editing,
inserting, reordering or deleting an entry breaks the chain from there on, and
`keepmum audit verify` says where.

What is recorded, and what never is:

- request: who sent it (client), where it went (provider, path), what keepmum did (outcome,
  status), counts by type, which detectors found what in new text, and which tools got real
  values back or kept placeholders. Never a value, a preview, a placeholder or a header.
- config: every change to a protection setting, with whether it weakens protection, and who
  made it (the keepmum command, the app, or an edit of the file). Allowlist entries and your
  own patterns are recorded as keyed fingerprints, since they may be values themselves.
- protect, exclude, include: an agent or a project taken out of keepmum's path, or put back.
- start, stop: a keepmum proxy began or ended, so gaps in coverage show.
- pruned: entries older than `[audit] keep_days` were removed; the chain continues from them.

What the chain cannot do on its own: someone who can write the file can also rewrite it from
some point on, recomputing every hash, or cut off its end. Both are caught only by comparing
with a hash kept elsewhere: `keepmum audit head` prints the latest one, `audit verify --anchor`
checks the log still contains it, and the app keeps one. A keyed signature would not help: the
key would sit in a file readable by the same user (the Keychain cannot be shared by keepmum's
processes without a prompt).
